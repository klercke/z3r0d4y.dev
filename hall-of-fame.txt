helped me in a significant way throughout my tech journey. This is sorted

# Personal Thanks 
    2021/11/2: Brian Bullis: Thanks for always being my guinea pig and going to
    such lengths as to try to test my pgp signatures on your iPhone.

# Website Tools
    2021/11/2: https://securitytxt.org/: This tool gave me a great idea of what
    to include in my security.txt file as well as inspiring the creation of
    this acknowledgements file.

    2021/11/2: https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy: This served as a good drop-in
    DNT policy. I do not collect user data, but felt like I should include
    this to raise the level of trust.
